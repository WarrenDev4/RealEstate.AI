RealEstate.AI is an AI-powered tool designed to help users make informed real estate decisions by analyzing available neighborhood data. It provides insights into market trends, neighborhood information, and comparable sales data. The tool includes features such as interactive maps, and neighborhood recommendations to support users in making confident real estate choices.

The real estate market is complex, often with vast amounts of unstructured and fragmented data. Investors, buyers, and real estate professionals often struggle to sift through this data to make accurate decisions. Traditional market analysis methods can lack efficiency and accuracy, potentially leading to poor investment choices. RealEstate.AI aims to solve this problem by leveraging artificial intelligence to process real estate data, offering neighborhood insights, and comparable sales data. With AI being driving force of innovation in software development and in many other industries, RealEstate.AIâ€™s goal is to provide users with actionable insights based on available data, helping them make informed and confident real estate decisions.

**Build of the Home Page (Sample data shown)**

The Home page is designed with a dashboard that allow users to select a state that will display real estate data based on its city, county or zip code. The real estate data will display on dashboard charts that will generate in real time from the API. With the utilization of Chart.js, users can gain insights on "Market Distribution", "Property Sales", and "Investment Types". Users can also view the Average Market Price, Recently Analyzed properties, Trending Neighborhoods and the Investment Score for each state based on location data. There is also a section called "AI-Powered Recommendations" where users can view recommendations on which top neighborhoods to look out for in "Top neighborhoods to watch", view property values that are increasing in "Rising property values", and view "Investment Oppurtunities". These features will be powered by Tensorflow's analysis of the data from the API.
