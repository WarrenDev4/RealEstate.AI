RealEstate.AI is an advanced AI-driven tool designed to analyze real estate market data. It provides insights into market trends, property valuations, neighborhood analysis, investment forecasting, and comparable sales data. The tool will include features like interactive maps, AI-powered property recommendations, risk assessment for investments, and predictive analytics to help users make informed decisions.

The real estate market is complex and driven with data, yet many investors, buyers, and real estate professionals struggle to make informed decisions due to the overwhelming amount of unstructured and fragmented market data. Some methods of market analysis often can lead to a lack accuracy, efficiency, and predictive insights, leading to poor investment decisions. RealEstate.AI aims to address this issue by leveraging artificial intelligence tools to analyze real estate market trends, provide accurate property valuations, assess neighborhood conditions, forecast investments, and compare sales data. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, RealEstate.AI empowers users to make data-driven, confident, and profitable real estate decisions.

**Update: I am currently working on the layout of all the main pages on the application. I am also creating the MySQL functionality for user authentication. I plan on adding an Real Estate API (Such as Zillow, RealEstateAPI, etc) for fetching real estate data in real time. I also plan on adding a Maps feature (In the Properties page) for viewing properties on interactive maps and to utilize street view features.**
