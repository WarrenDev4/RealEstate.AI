RealEstate.AI is an AI-powered tool designed to help users make informed real estate decisions by analyzing available property data. It provides insights into market trends, property valuations, neighborhood information, and comparable sales data. The tool includes features such as interactive maps, property comparisons, and property recommendations to support users in making confident real estate choices.

The real estate market is complex, often with vast amounts of unstructured and fragmented data. Investors, buyers, and real estate professionals often struggle to sift through this data to make accurate decisions. Traditional market analysis methods can lack efficiency and accuracy, potentially leading to poor investment choices. RealEstate.AI aims to solve this problem by leveraging artificial intelligence to process real estate data, offering basic property valuations, neighborhood insights, and comparable sales data. With AI driving innovation in many industries, RealEstate.AIâ€™s goal is to provide users with actionable insights based on available data, helping them make informed and confident real estate decisions.

**Update: I am currently working on the layout of all the main pages on the application.  I plan on adding an Real Estate API (ATTOM Property Data API) for fetching real estate data in real time. I also plan on adding a OpenStreetMap Maps feature (In the Properties page) for viewing properties on interactive maps and to utilize street view features. Major additions and implemenations will be coming very soon!**
